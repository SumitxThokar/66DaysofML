## Day 1 of #100daysOfML.
I am starting my machine learning with **AWS machine learning foundation**(free program).<br>
Today I learned what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved in creating a machine learning project.<br>
### Machine Learning
Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence without being explictly programmed.<br>
#### Types of Machine Learning
Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:
**Supervised learning**: Every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.
**Unsupervised learning**: There are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
**Reinforcement learning**: The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning.
#### Machine Learning steps
1. Define the problem
->Identify the machine learning task we might use to solve this problem.
2. Build the Dataset (Work with dataset)
-> The next step in the machine learning process is to build a dataset that can be used to solve your machine learning-based problem. Understanding the data needed helps you select better models and algorithms so you can build more effective solutions.
**Steps of working with data**
A.Data collection
Data collection can be as straightforward as running the appropriate SQL queries or as complicated as building custom web scraper applications to collect data for your project. You might even have to run a model over your data to generate needed labels.
B.Data inspection
The quality of your data will ultimately be the largest factor that affects how well you can expect your model to perform. As you inspect your data, look for:
Outliers.
Missing or incomplete values
Data that needs to be transformed or preprocessed so it's in the correct format to be used by your model
C.Summary statistics
Models can assume how your data is structured.
Now that you have some data in hand it is a good best practice to check that your data is in line with the underlying assumptions of your chosen machine learning model. With many statistical tools, you can calculate things like the mean, inner-quartile range (IQR), and standard deviation. These tools can give you insight into the scope, scale, and shape of the dataset.
D.Data visualization
You can use data visualization to see outliers and trends in your data and to help stakeholders understand your data.
