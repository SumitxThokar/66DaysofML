## Day 1 of Learning ML.
I am starting my machine learning with **Google Machine Learning Crash Course**.<br>
Today I learned what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved and types of machine learning.<br>
### Machine Learning
Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence without being explictly programmed.<br>
### Types of Machine Learning
Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:<br>
**Supervised learning**: Every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.<br>
**Unsupervised learning**: There are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.<br>
**Reinforcement learning**: The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning.<br>

### Regression vs. classification<br>
A **regression model** predicts continuous values. For example, regression models make predictions that answer questions like the following:<br>
- What is the value of a house in California?<br>-What is the probability that a user will click on this ad?
<br>A **classification model** predicts discrete values. For example, classification models make predictions that answer questions like the following:<br>
- Is a given email message spam or not spam?<br>
- Is this an image of a dog, a cat, or a hamster?<br>

## Day 2 of Learning ML.
Onto the journey of learning ML, Today I relate weights and biases in machine learning to slope and offset in line fitting, understand "loss" in general and squared loss in particular.<br>
### Training a model
Training a model simply means fitting labeled data(examples) into models from where the model learn good values for all weights and bias. A machine learning algorithm builds a model by observing many examples and determinines best parameters for the dataset that reduces **loss** or error in prediction. <br>
### Loss
Loss or Error is the number representing how bad the prediction was on a example  i.e. Loss= (Observation - Prediction).

In the image above, The blue line represent predictions made by the model, the yellow bubble represents actual value and the red line represents **loss**.
<br> 
### Loss function.
The method of measuring loss in meaning fashion is loss function. The most popular loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE).<br>
**Mean Squared Error** is the average squared loss of every example in the dataset.
