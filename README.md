## Day 1 of #100daysOfML.
I am starting my machine learning with **AWS machine learning foundation**(free program).<br>
Today I learned what machine learning is, common terminology, and common components involved in creating a machine learning project.<br>
### Machine Learning
Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence without being explictly programmed.<br>
#### Types of Machine Learning
Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:
**Supervised learning**: Every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.<br>
**Unsupervised learning**: There are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.<br>
**Reinforcement learning**: The algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning.<br>
